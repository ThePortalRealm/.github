# Contributing to The Portal Realm Projects

Thank you for helping shape **The Portal Realm**.

This file is shared across multiple repositories under the `ThePortalRealm`
umbrella: worldbuilding tools, TTRPG content, websites, and support libraries.
Each repo may have its own README or docs with project-specific details — always
read those first.

---

## 🧭 Where to Start

- **New idea, feature, or realm concept?**
  Open an issue in the target repo and describe:
  - What you want to add or change
  - How it fits the setting, tools, or player experience
  - Any drafts, references, or sketches

- **Bug fix or small technical improvement?**
  Check existing issues first. If nothing matches, open a new issue with:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Logs, screenshots, or error messages if available

- **Lore, docs, or content updates?**
  You can usually open a PR directly. If you’re changing rules, APIs,
  or public-facing tools, please link or create an issue.

## 🧱 Types of Repositories

The Portal Realm includes several kinds of projects, such as:

- **Worldbuilding & lore** – setting documents, realms, factions, timelines
- **TTRPG tools** – generators, helpers, and campaign utilities
- **Websites & portals** – campaign sites, reference hubs, and landing pages
- **Shared libraries & glue** – code and scripts used across multiple tools

For each repo:

- Check the **README** for setup or usage instructions.
- Look for a **`/docs`** folder or wiki for deeper lore or technical notes.
- Follow any repo-specific contribution guidelines there.

## 📝 How to Contribute

1. **Fork or branch from `main`**
   - External contributors: fork the repo on GitHub.
   - Collaborators: create a feature branch from `main`.

2. **Create or link an issue**
   - Reference an existing issue if one already tracks your change.
   - Otherwise, open a new issue and outline:
     - What you’re changing
     - Why it’s needed
     - Any impact on tools, lore, or other realms

3. **Keep canon and style in mind**
   - For lore/content: match the tone, themes, and constraints of the setting.
   - For tools: respect existing data formats, APIs, and user-facing behavior.

4. **Make focused, readable commits**
   - Group related changes together.
   - Use clear messages that explain *why* as well as *what*.
   - If the repo uses commit tags (e.g. `[skip ci]`, `[publish]`, `[publish-zip]`),
     follow any conventions noted in the README.

5. **Add tests or validation where appropriate**
   - For code: add or update unit/integration tests if present.
   - For generators or tools: consider sample inputs/outputs or fixtures.
   - For content: ensure links, references, and cross-doc navigation are correct.

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Clearly describe the change and link the related issue.
   - Mention if your change affects:
     - CI / GitHub Actions
     - Shared libraries or templates
     - Multiple repos, tools, or lore collections

7. **Respond to review**
   - Keep feedback constructive and focused on the work.
   - It’s fine to push follow-up commits — just keep them tidy and readable.

## 🔒 Security & Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue in a ThePortalRealm project:

- **Do not** open a public issue.
- Report privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](../../security/advisories) or email:
  **security@theportalrealm.com**

Please include:

- A clear description of the problem
- Steps or scripts to reproduce
- Any potential impact (users, sites, tools, or data)

We’ll coordinate fixes here and in any related repositories.

## 💡 Need Help?

If you’re unsure about:

- Which repo is the right place for your change
- How a tool, generator, or site is supposed to behave
- What impact your update might have on other realms, tools, or lore

Open a **“Question”** issue in the relevant repo with as much context as you can.

The Portal Realm is meant to be a shared world, not a locked vault — it’s always
okay to ask before you step through a new gate.
