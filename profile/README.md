# 🌌 The Portal Realm

> **A multiversal D&D experience — where every portal leads to a new story.**

---

### 🏙️ Welcome to Sakaar
Sakaar is a city surrounded by countless portals that deposit beings, artifacts, and mysteries from every imaginable world.  
Its origins are shrouded in myth — even its oldest inhabitants can’t recall a time before the portals began.

Time itself flows differently here.  
Some claim it moves faster, others slower.  
All agree on one thing: **no one truly escapes**.

Two broken moons, **Aakar** and **Sabyr**, drift overhead — remnants of a celestial body shattered the day the largest portal tore open.  
Those who try to leave through the portals always return, though days, years, or even lifetimes may pass in between.

Welcome to **The Portal Realm**, traveler.  
Will you accept your fate in Sakaar, or join the search for the way out?
