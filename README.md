# The Portal Realm — Organization Hub

Welcome to **The Portal Realm**, a collaborative world-building project and fantasy engine spanning stories, games, and systems.
This repository serves as the **central configuration and community home** for all Portal Realm projects.

---

## About the Project

The Portal Realm is a living world — part D&D campaign setting, part digital experiment, part story archive.
Across its portals lie countless places and stories:

> _The City of Sakaar, locked beneath a shimmering dome._
> _The Broken Moon of Aakar, whose shards whisper secrets through the Veil._
> _The Games of the Grandmaster, the shifting forests of Stonewood, the radiant towers of Forestcrown…_

Everything you see across our repositories — game code, world lore, wiki entries, and FoundryVTT content — links back to this shared realm.

## Shared Standards

All repos in the Portal Realm use a unified label and metadata system:

- **Core content:** `storyline`, `adventure`, `npc`, `location`, `event`
- **Lore/meta:** `lore-update`, `timeline`, `district`, `meta`
- **Technical:** `integration`, `performance`, `content-update`
- **Standard GitHub:** `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.

This consistency helps organize creative, technical, and narrative work across multiple mediums.
