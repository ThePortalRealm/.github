The Portal Realm is a D&D 5e Westmarch style gaming world. We utilize multiple dungeon masters to run sessions in addition to roleplaying NPCs in the discord server itself. We have a number of world builders who work together to craft the world for everyone to experience. We strive to maintain a unified storytelling format so there may be multiple storylines going at a time between each dungeon master that all feed into the overall storyline for the world.

All characters currently start at level 1, so you have a chance to learn your character as you level up through the various sessions and encounters. We encourage everyone to participate in the roleplaying experience in discord between events but to be mindful that some things will remain unanswered between events if a particular dungeon master is running the storyline it relates to.

We have out-of-character (OOC) discussion channels, as well as channels setup for asking the DMs questions, requesting specific roleplay content, or just making general suggestions for the server. We strive to remain transparency with all the players, and everyone is welcome to participate in discussions.

We also have a number of roleplaying channels for our primary location in the world, this allows your character to interact with other players, NPCs, and anything else between the scheduled events.
